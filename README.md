#### Predicting Customer Churn for Enhanced Customer Retention
In the fiercely competitive business landscape, companies strive to maximize their profits and revenue margins. One key area where industry players focus their resources is customer retention. Keeping existing customers happy and loyal is crucial for sustaining business growth and long-term success.
The primary goal of this project is to build a robust machine-learning model that predicts customer churn with high accuracy. By identifying customers who are likely to churn, companies can proactively implement targeted retention strategies, reducing churn rates, and boosting customer loyalty.
